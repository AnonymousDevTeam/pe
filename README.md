Privilege Escalation Scripts for SyncroMSP RMM Platform

As designed, pe-req.ps1 is triggered from a task try option.

Automated remediation should be configured in Syncro to resolve the "Privelege Escalation" alert type by running the pe.ps1 script on the host.

Syncro must be properly configured with automated remediation, alert types, etc.

Paths and Syncro subdomain will need to be configured appropriately.
